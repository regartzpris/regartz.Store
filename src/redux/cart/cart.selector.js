import { createSelector } from 'reselect';
//Reselect is a memoized selector function, composed of selectors, that returns something you want in your componentâ€™s props.
//Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
// Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
// Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

   // reduce() - native array method in js
    //The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.
    // The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).
    //The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).
    //Note: reduce() does not execute the function for array elements without values.
    // Note: this method does not change the original array. -- w3school--
